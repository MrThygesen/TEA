# TEA — Web3 Trust, Identity & Loyalty Platform
  
**Project TEA** is an innovative Web3 platform designed to revolutionize trust and identity by combining decentralized meetings, loyalty programs, smart legal contracts, and social agreements — all powered by blockchain technology.

Deployed on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, TEA leverages Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to provide verified identity and loyalty perks for individual and group interactions, alongside admin tools for creating enforceable agreements and future-proof escrow solutions.

### 🧭 Setting Up MetaMask for Web3 Access

If you're new to Web3, you'll need to install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as a browser extension.
To interact with our demo, you'll also need to **manually add the Polygon Amoy Testnet** to MetaMask (this is required, otherwise it won’t work).
