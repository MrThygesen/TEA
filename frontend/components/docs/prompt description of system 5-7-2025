give me a short task list to follow to get my current version up to date with the admin making the available SBT for free products or discounted one time products, annual meeting passes for whitelisted meeting spots with future perks. Discount agreement on returning meals, coffee, etc. 
Rhe user has to mint the SBT-offers - and buy something to get the points. The user will pay in TEA to get the poitns and apply the future discounts. this setup will be a good way combined with the DAO ambassador program to roll out a network where the next layer is that the restaurant will safe money on receiving payments in TEA.

i believe all contracs are actually enough, but if you want to look through all smart contracts and access what is needed. stepwise to get the react app working.
