Summary:
While specific platforms explicitly providing discounts for cafes, shops, and workspaces with integrated legal documentation aren't widespread yet, the concept certainly exists within the broader Web3 loyalty and membership space. Projects like NFT-gated access and community loyalty tokens are being adopted by physical spaces, especially in the coworking, art, and event sectors.

A practical approach could be:

Use NFTs or tokens as membership passes or discount vouchers.
Link policies, legal documents, or waivers via smart contracts or via QR codes attached to tokens.
Use existing loyalty or community platforms (like Collab.Land, Locker Room, or custom smart contracts) to automate access and legal compliance.
Would you like help in designing a sample legal document or discount setup for your project? Or recommendations on specific platforms to implement this?
