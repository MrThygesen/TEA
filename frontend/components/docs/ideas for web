Your project sounds exciting, and it’s a great idea to make the user interface both engaging and informative while emphasizing the value and purpose of the SBT tokens. Here are some design ideas and content suggestions to enhance your demo screen, convey trust, and clarify the benefits:

---

### Overall Visual & Layout Ideas:
- **Modern, clean look**: Use a sleek, minimalistic style with subtle animations (e.g., dropdown folding out, button hover effects).
- **Color scheme**: Soft pastels or brand colors combined with contrasting accents (like gold or green) to signify value and trust.
- **Typography**: Clear, professional fonts with hierarchy—larger for titles, smaller for details.

---

### Suggested UI Structure & Content:

#### Header (Persistent across screens)
**“TEA Project Demo”**  
*Animated or stylish font, perhaps with a light background or subtle graphic.*

---

#### Wallet Status Panel (Persistent)
- **Wallet Balance:** `99.12 MATIC` (with a small icon to indicate blockchain/crypto)
- **Wallet Address (shortened):** `0xaB…BB94`
- **Connected as:** `0xaBEd0f8e61F6dc18008A6ec5eA6CDc2f34c7BB94`

*(Optional: a small refresh icon or disconnect button)*

---

#### Main Claim SBT Section
**"Claim Your SBT"**  
*Bold, prominent.*

**Subtext (optional but recommended):**  
_"Unlock exclusive benefits, legal access, and network perks by claiming your Soulbound Token (SBT)."_

---

#### Description & Explanation
Add a paragraph that reinforces the purpose and value:

> **Connect with our partners to access exclusive perks for private and business use. Your SBT serves as a legal and network access token, simplifying agreements and opening doors to trusted collaborations.**

*Use icons or small graphic elements to symbolize legal, network, and perks.*

---

#### Token Category / Type Selection
- **Dropdown menu or toggle buttons** for `Category 1`, `Category 2`, etc.
- When expanded, show the list of tokens (or options) for each category.
- Consider adding a **"Learn More"** tooltip or info icon explaining each category's benefits.

---

#### Button
**"Claim SBT"**  
- Make this button prominent, perhaps with a call-to-action color (e.g., green or deep blue).

---

### Design & UX Enhancements:
- **Progress Indicator:** Show a small progress bar or checkmark once connected or claimed.
- **Legal & Perks Info Tooltip:**  
  - Hover or click on a small info icon near the claim button or dropdown:  
    > _"Claiming an SBT grants verified access, legal agreements, and network perks with our trusted partners."_
- **Explain the value of the token:**  
  - “Your SBT embodies real-world value, granting simplified legal processes and exclusive access to networks—both digital and physical.”

---

### Onboarding or Next Steps
Once claimed, consider transitioning to a more engaging interface:
- Show a **confirmation modal** with a summary.
- Display **perks or partner access points**.
- Help users understand how to use or transfer their SBT (if applicable).

---

### Summary:
This layout keeps it simple but meaningful. The key is to emphasize trust, clarity of value, and the connection to real-world benefits—legal, network, and perks.
